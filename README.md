# My PopClip extensions
When I make [PopClip](https://www.popclip.app) extensions that I think can be useful to other people I will put them here.

_(To install, download and open the file ending in .popclipextz)_

- [Rephrase](https://github.com/beesinblenders/popclip/blob/main/rephrase.popclipextz) — uses OpenAI API to provide 5 replacements for selected word or expression
- [Word comment](https://github.com/beesinblenders/popclip/blob/main/wordcomment.popclipextz) — inserts a comment on the selected text in MS Word ⚠️ _adapt the script to your version of Word_
- [Append to Quick Draft](https://github.com/beesinblenders/popclip/blob/main/appendToQuickDraft.popclipextz) — appends the selected text to your [Quick Draft](https://quickdraft.app) scratchpad
