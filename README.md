# My PopClip extensions
When I make [PopClip](https://www.popclip.app) extensions that I think can be useful to other people I will put them here.

_(To install, download and open the file ending in .popclipextz)_

- [Rephrase](https://github.com/beesinblenders/popclip/blob/main/rephrase.popclipextz) : uses OpenAI API to provide 5 replacements for selected word or expression. _For use in other languages, you may get better results if you edit the code and translate the user prompt in line 30._
